# VIM Alt-Tab for gnome-shell
The goal of this extension is to let you switch between windows or applications using `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` instead of the standards arrows. It tries to make you gain time when using vim, as your fingers are, probably, already on these keys!

## Credits
The conceptual part of the extension comes from [AlternateTab](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/15/alternatetab/).

## TODO
 - Add settings to let people chose other combinations than `hjkl`. For instance `WASD` might also be popular. Don't hesitate to reach me out if you'd need this.
